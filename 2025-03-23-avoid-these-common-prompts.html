  <h1>Avoid These Common Prompts</h1>
  <p><em>Posted on March 23, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Copilot is powerful, but like any assistant, it performs best with clear instructions. Some prompt styles can trip it up or lead to irrelevant code. Let’s fix that.</p>

  <h3>❌ Too Vague</h3>
  <p>A prompt like <code>// write code</code> gives Copilot almost nothing to work with. Be specific about what you want — think input, output, and purpose.</p>

  <h2>❌ Too Many Tasks in One Prompt</h2>
  <p>“Create a function to sort and then filter a list and save it to a file” — whoa, slow down! Break that into multiple prompts or comments. It’ll handle each one more accurately.</p>

  <h2>❌ Missing Context</h2>
  <p>Copilot works best with the full picture. If you’re prompting it without any surrounding code or types, the suggestions may not align with your actual app or language.</p>

  <h2>✅ Better Prompting Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>// returns true if the email is valid</code></li>
    <li><code>// fetch user data from API and cache the result</code></li>
    <li><code>// write a Jest test for this function</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Clear and focused prompts = better results, less editing, and faster dev time. Clean prompts are king.</p>

  <p>Happy coding!</p>
