  <h1>Copilot vs. Chat: Sidekick Showdown</h1>
  <p><em>Posted on March 24, 2025</em></p>

  <p>GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat are both awesome, but they shine in different ways. Think of them as Batman and Robin — both powerful, but with different roles on your dev team.</p>

  <h2>Inline Copilot Suggestions: Your Typing Time-Saver</h2>
  <p>Copilot’s inline autocomplete works best when you already know where you're going. It’s great for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing repetitive code (loops, API calls, config files)</li>
    <li>Stubbing out boilerplate</li>
    <li>Generating tests quickly</li>
    <li>Speeding through common logic patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Copilot Chat: Your Dev Assistant on Demand</h2>
  <p>Copilot Chat is ideal when you need clarity, ideas, or troubleshooting help. It’s like pair programming with an expert who never sleeps. Use it for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Explaining what a piece of code does</li>
    <li>Refactoring suggestions or alternatives</li>
    <li>Debugging help and error context</li>
    <li>Writing code from scratch based on a problem description</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Use Which?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inline Copilot</strong>: Use when you’re typing code and want fast, in-flow completions.</li>
    <li><strong>Copilot Chat</strong>: Use when you’re thinking, stuck, or exploring options.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Both tools make a killer combo. Use inline Copilot for speed and flow. Call in Copilot Chat when you need a second brain. You don’t have to pick a favorite — use them both like a pro.</p>

  <p>Check back often for another dev-friendly dish!</p>
  <p>Happy coding!</p>
