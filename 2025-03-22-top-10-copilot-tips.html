  <h1>Top 10 Copilot Tips</h1>
  <p><em>Posted on March 23, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Ready to level up your GitHub Copilot game? Whether you’re just starting or already jamming with it daily, these 10 quick tips will help you get the most out of your coding sidekick:</p>

  <h2>1. Use Comments to Guide It</h2>
  <p>Write a comment that clearly describes what you want. Example: <code>// validate email input</code>. Copilot loves clarity.</p>

  <h2>2. Start the Function or Line</h2>
  <p>Just typing <code>function formatDate(</code> is often enough for Copilot to complete a smart, useful block of code.</p>

  <h2>3. Break Problems into Smaller Prompts</h2>
  <p>Big asks like "build a login system" are too much. Break it down: "create login form," "validate input," etc.</p>

  <h2>4. Use Descriptive Variable Names</h2>
  <p>Good naming helps Copilot understand intent and generate better suggestions around your variables and logic.</p>

  <h2>5. Try Natural Language Prompts</h2>
  <p>Copilot understands human-style instructions surprisingly well. Try things like <code>// add error handling for this</code>.</p>

  <h2>6. Use It to Refactor</h2>
  <p>Comment something like <code>// simplify this function</code> above complex code, and Copilot often offers a cleaner version.</p>

  <h2>7. Don’t Be Afraid to Regenerate</h2>
  <p>If you don’t like the suggestion, hit the regenerate button or rephrase your prompt slightly — better options often follow.</p>

  <h2>8. Use It for Test Generation</h2>
  <p>Comment like <code>// write a unit test for this method</code> and Copilot will draft it. Great for speeding up test coverage.</p>

  <h2>9. Prompt It to Explain Code</h2>
  <p>Want to learn what something does? Use Copilot Chat and ask <code>Explain what this function does</code> — great for onboarding!</p>

  <h2>10. Review and Edit, Always</h2>
  <p>Copilot is smart, but not perfect. Treat it like a co-pilot — review its output, make it yours, and steer the ship.</p>

  <p>Keep these tips in your toolbelt and let Copilot help you write cleaner, faster, and more confidently.</p>

  <p>Happy coding!</p>
