    <h1>From Tool to Teammate</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Jan 2, 2026</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      Welcome to 2026!<br>
      As we kick off a new year, it’s a great moment to reset how we think about GitHub Copilot.<br>
      Over the past year, many of us started using it as a faster way to write code. That was a good first step.<br>
      But in 2026, the real shift is this, GitHub Copilot works best when you treat it like a teammate, not just a tool.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>
    <div class="protip">
      <b>Stop Asking for Code, Start Collaborating</b><br>
      A tool waits for instructions. A teammate understands intent, asks questions, and helps you think through problems.<br>
      GitHub Copilot can do the same, if you invite it into the conversation the right way.<br>
      Instead of only asking for answers, start sharing context, goals, and constraints. That’s when GitHub Copilot becomes far more useful.

    <div class="section-title">✅ What “Teammate Mode” Looks Like in Practice</div>

    <p>
      <b>1️⃣ Use Copilot to Think Before You Code</b><br>
      Before writing a single line, try:<br>
      <code>Help me think through the approach for this feature and call out potential risks.</code><br>
      This shifts Copilot from code generator to planning partner.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2️⃣ Ask for Feedback, Not Just Output</b><br>
      Instead of:<br>
      <code>Refactor this function</code><br>
      Try:<br>
      <code>Review this function and suggest improvements for readability and maintainability.</code><br>
      You get options, tradeoffs, and reasoning, not just rewritten code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3️⃣ Let Copilot Ask Questions</b><br>
      A strong teammate does not assume.<br>
      <code>Before making changes, ask clarifying questions about expected behavior and edge cases.</code><br>
      This often prevents rework later.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4️⃣ Use Copilot as a Second Set of Eyes</b><br>
      <code>Review this code as if you were joining the project for the first time.</code><br>
      Great for clarity, naming, and hidden assumptions.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">A Quick Reality Check</div>
    <p>
      GitHub Copilot is not a replacement for judgment.<br>
      Teammates still review each other’s work. The same applies here.<br>
      Use Copilot to move faster and think clearer, but keep responsibility where it belongs.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      In 2026, the biggest gains with GitHub Copilot do not come from typing faster.<br>
      They come from working better. When you treat Copilot like a teammate, planning with it, reviewing with it, and thinking alongside it, the quality of your work improves across the board.
