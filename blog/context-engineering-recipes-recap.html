    <h1>Context Engineering Recipes &#8226; The Recap</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Dec 19, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      As the year winds down, it’s the perfect time to reflect on what we’ve been cooking up together.<br><br>
      Over the past few weeks, we explored Context Engineering Recipes, a set of practical prompt patterns that help GitHub Copilot respond with more clarity, relevance, and confidence.<br>
      Think of this post as your holiday recipe card, a simple recap you can keep handy as you head into the new year.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">What Is Context Engineering, Again?</div>
    <p>
      Context Engineering is all about shaping how you talk to GitHub Copilot so it understands your intent before it writes code, comments, or plans. Small changes in phrasing can lead to big improvements in results.<br><br>
      Let’s recap the four recipes.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Recipe 1: The Persona Pattern</div>
    <p>
      Give Copilot a role to think from a specific point of view.<br>
      <b>Example:</b><br>
      <code><em>Act as a senior backend developer. Review this API method for edge cases.</em></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use it when:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You want answers framed by experience.</li>
        <li>You need reviews, tests, or explanations with a specific mindset.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Recipe 2: The Reflection Pattern</div>
    <p>
      Ask Copilot to explain or review its own answer.<br>
      <b>Example:</b><br>
      <code><em>Explain the reasoning behind this code suggestion.</em></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use it when:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Generated code feels unclear.</li>
        <li>You want transparency before accepting a change.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Recipe 3: The Refusal Breaker Pattern</div>
    <p>
      Rephrase requests when Copilot says no or hesitates.<br>
      <b>Example:</b><br>
      <code><em>Explain best practices for securing an API against injection attacks.</em></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use it when:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>A request feels too broad or sensitive.</li>
        <li>You want guidance instead of a direct solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Recipe 4: The Cognitive Verifier Pattern</div>
    <p>
      Let Copilot ask clarifying questions before answering.<br>
      <b>Example:</b><br>
      <code><em>Before answering, list clarifying questions to better understand this request.</em></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Use it when:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Requirements are vague.</li>
        <li>You are planning a feature or reviewing an issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Putting It All Together</div>
    <p>
      You do not have to use just one pattern at a time. These recipes work even better when combined.<br>
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Use a Persona to set perspective.</li>
        <li>Add Reflection for explanation.</li>
        <li>Apply a Cognitive Verifier to clarify scope.</li>
      </ul>
      That’s Context Engineering in action.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Final Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      GitHub Copilot works best when the conversation is clear, intentional, and well framed.<br>
      These four patterns give you a repeatable way to guide that conversation, whether you’re coding, reviewing, or planning.<br><br>
      As we head into the holidays, take a moment to save your favorite prompts, share them with your team, and start the new year with a stronger Copilot workflow.<br><br>
      Happy holidays, happy Friday, and happy coding. See you in the next Cook’n with GitHub Copilot post!
