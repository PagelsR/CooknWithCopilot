    <h1>Picking the Right AI Model for Your Task</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Sep 19, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      GitHub Copilot supports multiple AI models, each with different strengths.<br>
      Some are lightweight and fast, others provide deeper reasoning and longer context.<br>
      If you match the model to your task, you will spend less time retrying prompts and more time shipping code.
    </p>

      <b>Match the Model to What You’re Trying to Do</b><br>
      The models available to you depend on your GitHub Copilot plan, Free, Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise.<br>
      Start with what is enabled for your account, then refine based on the type of work you are doing.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Try These Approaches</div>
    <p>
      <b>1️⃣ Default Model, Business or Enterprise</b><br>
      If you are using GitHub Copilot for Business or Enterprise, your admin decides which models are available.<br>
      Common options can include GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude Sonnet 4.<br>
      In this setup, start with the default model and adjust your prompts for clarity.<br>
      If results feel off, ask your admin what is enabled, some organizations restrict access to premium models.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2️⃣ Manual Selection, Individual Plans</b><br>
      On GitHub Copilot Free, Pro, or Pro+, you can often choose from multiple models directly.<br>
      • For quick edits, repetitive code, or boilerplate, use a smaller, faster model like <i>o3-mini</i>.<br>
      • For complex features, multi-file reasoning, or planning, use a stronger model such as <i>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</i> or <i>o1-preview</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3️⃣ Compare Outputs to Learn What Fits Best</b><br>
      If you have access to more than one model, run the same prompt with each. Ask yourself:<br>
      • Which one handled edge cases better?<br>
      • Which one gave clearer, more maintainable code?<br>
      • Which one matched your team’s coding style best?
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Important Note</div>
    <p>
      Premium requests may be consumed when using premium models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.<br>
      Keep this in mind if you are working within request limits or monitoring usage.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      Not all GitHub Copilot setups give you the same choices.<br>
      On Business or Enterprise, your admin decides which models are enabled.<br>
      On Free or Pro tiers, you can experiment directly.<br>
      Either way, choosing the right model for the job makes Copilot faster, more reliable, and easier to use day to day.
