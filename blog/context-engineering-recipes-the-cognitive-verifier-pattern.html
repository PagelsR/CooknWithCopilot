    <h1>Context Engineering Recipes &#8226; The Cognitive Verifier Pattern</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Nov 21, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      So far, you have learned how to guide Copilot with Personas, encourage Reflection, and rephrase with the Refusal Breaker.<br>
      This week’s recipe, the Cognitive Verifier Pattern, is all about asking smarter before you answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes Copilot gives an answer too soon. Other times, your own prompt might be vague or incomplete.<br>
      The Cognitive Verifier Pattern helps GitHub Copilot pause, clarify, and ask questions before diving into a solution.

      <b>Let Copilot Ask Before It Acts</b><br>
      Think of this as giving Copilot permission to say, “Hold on, what exactly do you mean?”<br>
      By prompting it to generate clarifying questions, you train Copilot to think through the request like a thoughtful teammate instead of jumping straight to code.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Try These Approaches</div>

    <p>
      <b>1️⃣ Ask Copilot to Verify Understanding</b><br>
      <code>Before answering, list 2–3 clarifying questions you would ask to make sure you fully understand my request.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Big or open ended tasks like “Build a dashboard” or “Add an integration.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2️⃣ Combine with Reflection for Better Accuracy</b><br>
      <code>Before writing code, list questions that would help you understand potential edge cases or risks.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Complex logic or architectural changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3️⃣ Use It to Strengthen Requirements</b><br>
      <code>Generate a few clarifying questions a developer should ask before implementing this feature request.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Issue driven workflows, planning sessions, or backlog grooming.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4️⃣ Help Copilot Focus on the Right Context</b><br>
      <code>Before suggesting improvements, ask questions about the purpose of this function and its expected behavior.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Code reviews, refactors, or ambiguous legacy functions.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Tip</div>
    <p>
      Sometimes the fastest path to a good answer is a short pause.<br>
      Let Copilot question your prompt first, you will save time correcting assumptions later.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      The Cognitive Verifier Pattern turns GitHub Copilot into a true collaborator that does not just code, it thinks with you.<br>
      Clarity before completion leads to cleaner, more accurate results.
