    <h1>Work Smarter Across Multiple Files</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Aug 22, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      Sometimes the bug or feature you’re working on doesn’t live in a single file. It spans a controller, a model, and maybe even a test.<br>
      That’s where <b>GitHub Copilot’s multi-file context</b> comes in. It can reason across your entire project, not just the file in front of you, making its suggestions more complete and accurate.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>

      <b>Use Copilot to Understand and Connect Multiple Files</b><br>
      Instead of copy-pasting code from one file into another or losing track of relationships, you can ask Copilot to connect the dots directly.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Try These Approaches</div>
    <p>
      <b>1️⃣ Copilot Chat: Cross-File Help</b><br>
      <code># How does data flow from the API route in routes/user.js to the database model in models/user.js?</code><br>
      Copilot pulls context from both files and explains the connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2️⃣ Edit Mode: Refactor Across Files</b><br>
      Highlight code in one file and type:<br>
      <code># Update this method so it stays consistent with changes in services/userService.js</code><br>
      Copilot revises the code while checking other related files.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3️⃣ Agent Mode: Bigger Picture</b><br>
      <i>Summarize how authentication works across this repo, including middleware, routes, and tests.</i><br>
      Copilot Agent Mode gives you a high-level overview of connected logic.

      <li># Show me where this function is called across the project</li>
      <li># Summarize all tests that validate the login process</li>
      <li># Find inconsistencies between this API response and its usage in the frontend</li>
