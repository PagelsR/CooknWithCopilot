    <h1>Craft Prompts That Get Better Results</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on May 23, 2025</em></p>

      Sometimes, a short prompt works just fine—but when Copilot’s suggestions miss the mark, it’s time to sharpen your prompt game. The key? Be specific, add context, and guide it like you would a junior dev. Let’s break it down!<br>

      Use Structured Prompts to Guide Copilot to the Right Solution<br>
      Large language models respond better when you spell out what you want with more clarity. You don’t need fancy language—just think step-by-step, and stay focused.<br>
      Here’s a simple formula to use:<br>
      [Goal] + [Tech/Context] + [Constraints or Style]<br>
      Examples of Clear, Effective Prompts:<br>
      1️⃣ Task + Context:<br>
      # Write a Python function that parses a CSV and returns rows where age &gt; 30<br>
      Simple, direct, and goal-focused.<br>
      2️⃣ Structure it step-by-step:<br>
      # Step-by-step:<br>
      # 1. Read a CSV file<br>
      # 2. Filter rows by a column value<br>
      # 3. Return filtered list<br>
      This often results in cleaner, better-organized code.<br>
      3️⃣ Style or Approach Guidance:<br>
      // Write a TypeScript function that uses map/filter instead of a for loop<br>
      Perfect for shaping the style of Copilot’s output.<br>
      <br>
      4️⃣ Use a Persona-Based Prompt<br>
      // Act like a senior front-end engineer writing a reusable button component in React with TypeScript and Tailwind<br>
      Giving Copilot a role helps it follow conventions and patterns a real expert might use.<br>
      5️⃣ Use a Context-Framing Prompt<br>
      # This YAML defines a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every push to the main branch using Node.js 18<br>
      Giving Copilot a quick summary of what the file is for helps generate accurate boilerplate that fits your workflow.<br>
      <br>
      Prompt Debugging Tip:<br>
      If the output isn’t quite right, reword your comment with more details or add one step at a time. Think of it like teaching a new teammate—specific instructions lead to better results.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Quick Takeaway</strong><br>
      When Copilot feels off, it’s not stuck—it just needs a better prompt. Add structure, be specific, and watch the quality improve.<br>
