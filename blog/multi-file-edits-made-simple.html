    <h1>Multi-File Edits Made Simple</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Sep 12, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      Sometimes a change touches more than one file: renaming a function, updating imports, or refactoring a shared utility.<br>
      Instead of fixing each file one by one, you can now use <b>Copilot Edits with multi-file support</b> (in preview) to apply consistent changes across your project, review diffs, and accept or reject them with a single flow.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>

      <b>Use Multi-File Edits for Wide Refactors Without Losing Control</b><br>
      Copilot Edits doesn’t just touch the file in front of you. It looks across your project, proposes updates in related files, and gives you a diff view so you can stay in charge of what gets applied.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Try These Approaches</div>
    <p>
      <b>1️⃣ Refactor Across Files</b><br>
      <code># Update all references to getUserData to use the new fetchUserData function</code><br>
      Copilot finds and suggests changes wherever the old function is used.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2️⃣ Modernize Imports</b><br>
      <code># Change all CommonJS require statements to ES module imports</code><br>
      Perfect for keeping syntax consistent across modules.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3️⃣ Keep Your Style Consistent</b><br>
      <code># Apply async/await instead of promise chains in all service files</code><br>
      Copilot proposes edits file-by-file, so you can accept the ones that fit best.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4️⃣ Preview Before You Apply</b><br>
      Every suggestion shows up as a diff. Accept, reject, or tweak them just like you would in a pull request.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Extra Prompts to Try</div>
    <ul>
      <li># Replace deprecated helper function calls with the updated version</li>
      <li># Update API routes and adjust the corresponding tests</li>
      <li># Standardize error handling across controllers</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      With multi-file Copilot Edits, you can handle wide refactors in minutes instead of hours.<br>
      You’re still in control, but GitHub Copilot does the busywork.
