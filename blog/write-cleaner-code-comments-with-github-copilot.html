    <h1>Write Cleaner Code Comments with GitHub Copilot</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Aug 1, 2025</em></p>
    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      Code that works is good. Code that‚Äôs clear is even better.<br>
      Well-written comments help teammates (and future you) understand the why behind the code.<br>
      With GitHub Copilot, you don‚Äôt need to pause and think too hard.<br>
      Just prompt it to draft comments that make your logic easier to follow.<br>
      Let‚Äôs break it down! üìùüíª
    </p>
    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>
    <div class="protip">
      <b>Ask Copilot to Generate Comments That Explain Your Code Clearly</b><br>
      Instead of leaving code bare, or writing vague notes, use Copilot Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode to quickly generate helpful, structured comments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Try These Approaches</b><br>
      <b>1Ô∏è‚É£ Copilot Chat: Add Explanations</b><br>
      <code># Add inline comments explaining each step of this function</code><br>
      Great for walking through logic in complex methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit Mode: Comment While You Code</b><br>
      Highlight a block and type:<br>
      <code># Add docstrings to describe inputs, outputs, and edge cases</code><br>
      Copilot will generate docstrings that make functions easier to reuse.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Mode: Review for Readability</b><br>
      Review this file and suggest clearer inline comments where the logic might confuse a new developer.<br>
      Perfect when onboarding teammates or preparing for a code review.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Extra Prompts to Try</b>
      <ul>
        <li># Add comments that explain the purpose of each class property</li>
        <li>// Generate a top-level comment explaining what this script does</li>
        <li># Add inline notes for this algorithm to clarify performance trade-offs</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Quick Takeaway</b><br>
      Readable code is not only about syntax.<br>
      With a few well-placed prompts, Copilot can help you document logic as you write it, making your code easier to maintain and share.
