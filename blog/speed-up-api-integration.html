    <h1>Speed Up API Integration with GitHub Copilot</h1>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Connecting your application to an API often means jumping between docs, writing boilerplate, and testing requests until they work. With GitHub Copilot, you can skip a lot of the overhead and focus on the part that matters — making your app actually do something useful.</p>

    <p><strong>ProTip:</strong> Pair Copilot’s suggestions with your own knowledge of the API docs. You’ll catch edge cases while Copilot speeds through the setup.</p>

    <h2>Try This Approach</h2>
    <p>Instead of manually setting up every call, you can prompt Copilot like this:</p>

    <pre><code>Write a function in JavaScript that calls the OpenWeatherMap API,
fetches the current temperature for a given city,
and returns it in Celsius.</code></pre>

    <p>Copilot will generate the fetch logic, handle query parameters, and return structured results. From there, you can refine the code with follow-up prompts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><pre><code>“Add error handling if the city is not found.”</code></pre></li>
      <li><pre><code>“Update the function to use async/await instead of promises.”</code></pre></li>
      <li><pre><code>“Return the response as a formatted string, not just JSON.”</code></pre></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick Takeaway</h2>
    <p>By iterating this way, you get working API code much faster while still keeping full control over the details.</p>
