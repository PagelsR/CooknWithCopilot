    <h1>Speed Up API Integration with GitHub Copilot</h1>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      Connecting your application to an API often means jumping between docs, writing boilerplate, and testing requests until they work.<br>
      With GitHub Copilot, you can skip a lot of the overhead and focus on the part that matters — making your app actually do something useful.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>
    <div class="protip">
      <b>Pair Copilot’s suggestions with your own knowledge of the API docs.</b><br>
      You’ll catch edge cases while Copilot speeds through the setup.
      <br><br>

      <b>Try This Approach</b><br>
      Instead of manually setting up every call, you can prompt Copilot like this:<br>
      <code>Write a function in JavaScript that calls the OpenWeatherMap API,<br>
      fetches the current temperature for a given city,<br>
      and returns it in Celsius.</code>
      <br><br>

      Copilot will generate the fetch logic, handle query parameters, and return structured results. From there, you can refine the code with follow-up prompts:
      <ul>
        <li><code>Add error handling if the city is not found.</code></li>
        <li><code>Update the function to use async/await instead of promises.</code></li>
        <li><code>Return the response as a formatted string, not just JSON.</code></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Takeaway:</b><br>
      By iterating this way, you get working API code much faster while still keeping full control over the details.
