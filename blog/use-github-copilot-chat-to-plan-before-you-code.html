    <h1>Use GitHub Copilot Chat to Plan Before You Code</h1>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      We’ve all hit that moment when we’re staring at a blank screen, trying to figure out how to structure a new feature. GitHub Copilot isn’t just for finishing code, it’s great at <i>starting conversations</i> too.<br>
      Let’s break it down!
    </p>
    <div class="section-title">ProTip</div>
    <div class="protip">
      <b>Start with a conversation.</b> Let GitHub Copilot help you map out your logic, edge cases, and structure, before you ever write a function.
      <br><br>
      <b>Try This in GitHub Copilot Chat:</b><br>
      <code>
        Help me outline the steps to build a login flow that checks credentials, tracks failed attempts, and redirects users based on roles.
      </code>
      <br><br>
      <i>What happens next?</i> GitHub Copilot responds with a logical breakdown—almost like pair programming—with edge cases, key checks, and a clean outline to work from.
      <br><br>
      <b>Follow-Up Prompt:</b><br>
      <code>
        Now turn that into a JavaScript function with placeholders for the missing logic.
      </code>
      <br><br>
      And just like that—you’re rolling.
      <br><br>
      Before you dive into implementation, getting GitHub Copilot to walk you through the problem helps:
      <ul>
        <li>- Clarify your thinking</li>
        <li>- Avoid rework</li>
        <li>- Expose assumptions</li>
        <li>- Generate better structure</li>
      </ul>
      It’s like having a planning buddy that never gets tired.
      <br><br>
      <b>Quick Takeaway</b><br>
      GitHub Copilot isn’t just a code generator, it’s a thought partner.<br>
      Talk through your logic first, then let it build around your plan.
      <br><br>
      What’s the most surprising thing GitHub Copilot helped you figure out before you started coding?<br>
