    <h1>Context Engineering Recipes ‚Äî The Reflection Pattern</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on Oct 31, 2025</em></p>

    <div class="section-title">Usage</div>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs time for another Cook‚Äôn with GitHub Copilot ProTip, continuing our Context Engineering Recipes mini series.<br>
      Last time, you learned how the Persona Pattern gives Copilot a role to think like a pro.<br>
      Today‚Äôs recipe is the Reflection Pattern, it teaches Copilot to look in the mirror and explain its own reasoning. No magic potions required, just smarter prompts for deeper understanding.<br>
      And remember, GitHub Copilot does not ghost you, it just needs the right rephrase. üëª

      <b>Ask Copilot to Reflect Before You Correct</b><br>
      When you ask GitHub Copilot why it made a suggestion, you are not second guessing, you are guiding.<br>
      <br>Reflection prompts help Copilot surface its assumptions and logic, so you can decide whether its answer truly fits your intent.

    <p>
      <b>1Ô∏è‚É£ Self Explanation</b><br>
      Prompt Copilot to explain how it reached a result.<br>
      <code>Explain the reasoning behind this code suggestion, step by step.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Understanding non obvious logic or complex generated code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>2Ô∏è‚É£ Self Critique</b><br>
      Ask Copilot to review its own output before you do.<br>
      <code>Review your previous answer. Identify any logical or security issues and suggest improvements.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Code audits, refactoring, or design reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection Before Rewrite</b><br>
      Get Copilot to evaluate before editing.<br>
      <code>Before refactoring, explain what parts of this function are redundant or risky to change.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Safer rewrites and better context awareness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>4Ô∏è‚É£ Teach Back Mode</b><br>
      Have Copilot explain as if it were mentoring a new developer.<br>
      <code>Explain this function to a junior developer and include why each step is needed.</code><br>
      <i>Best for:</i> Documentation, onboarding, and code walkthroughs.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Tip</div>
    <p>
      Reflection prompts do not slow you down, they sharpen the reasoning.<br>
      If GitHub Copilot‚Äôs answer feels spooky vague, ask it why. You will get clarity instead of mystery.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Quick Takeaway</div>
    <p>
      The Reflection Pattern turns Copilot into your debugging sidekick, one that can explain its thoughts before you accept its help.<br>
      No haunted logic here, just transparent, confident collaboration.<br>
      Do you ever ask Copilot to explain its answers? Try the Reflection Pattern this week and share your favorite reflective prompts!
