      When you’re stuck, vague prompts won’t get you far. Copilot thrives on clear, specific questions. Instead of hoping it reads your mind, give it the context it needs. Let’s break it down!<br>

      Be Direct—Ask Copilot Chat Exactly What You Need<br>
      The better your question, the better your answer. Think about what you’d ask a teammate—and say that.<br>
      <br>
      Try these examples:<br>
      Instead of this vague prompt:<br>
      # Fix this<br>
       Ask this instead:<br>
      # This function is timing out, can you suggest a more efficient approach?<br>
       Instead of:<br>
      # Add comments<br>
      Try:<br>
      # Add inline comments that explain this logic to someone new to the codebase<br>
      <br>
      Want help improving a prompt?<br>
      Use Copilot to help you write better prompts!<br>
      In Copilot Chat:<br>
      # Help me write a clear prompt to generate a validation function that checks email and phone number formats<br>
      <br>
      Bonus Tip: Ask Copilot to Review Your Prompt<br>
      Before submitting a long or complex prompt, try:<br>
      # Is this a good prompt? If not, suggest a better one.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Quick Takeaway</strong><br>
      GitHub Copilot is only as smart as the question you ask. If your results seem off, it’s often the prompt—not the tool. Treat it like a coding partner, and be clear about what you need.<br>
