      Naming things is hard. Whether it’s a new function, a database field, or a variable inside a loop, finding the right name can break your flow. GitHub Copilot can help suggest clear, consistent names based on the surrounding code and its intended purpose. Let’s break it down!<br>

      Use Copilot to Generate Better Names—Functionally and Descriptively<br>
      Instead of overthinking or leaving temp, foo, or xyz in your code, ask Copilot for name suggestions that are more descriptive and easier to maintain.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s how to do it:<br>
      1️⃣ Copilot Chat: Ask for a Better Name<br>
      // Suggest a more descriptive name for this function that calculates discount based on user role and cart total<br>
      2️⃣ Edit Mode: Inline Rename Prompt<br>
      Highlight the function or variable, then use a comment like:<br>
      # Rename this variable to better reflect what it represents<br>
      Then trigger Copilot Agent Mode and apply the change in one go.<br>
      3️⃣ Agent Mode: Naming Conventions at Scale<br>
      Generate consistent variable and method names across all controllers based on their purpose (CRUD pattern)<br>
      Perfect for larger refactors or codebase cleanups.<br>
      <br>
      Extra Prompts to Try:<br>
      	• # Rename this class to better describe what it models<br>
      	• # What’s a better name for this loop counter?<br>
      	• # Suggest field names for a form collecting user contact details<br>
      	• // Rename this test to clearly describe what it&#x27;s testing<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Quick Takeaway</strong><br>
      Don’t let naming slow you down. Let Copilot help you pick clear, practical names that make your code easier to read—and easier to revisit next week.<br>
